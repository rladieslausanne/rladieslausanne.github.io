      <description>I think there is a lot of power in it in Bayesian statistics. The problem is the heavy entrance threshold. So I am always very happy to talk about the benefits of Bayesian statistics and show how easy and simple a model can look like.
 In past April, Elizaveta Semenova  gave an introduction to Bayesian inference in R, using Stan at our third meetup. In the meantime we had the chance to chat with her about her background and current work.</description>
