      <description>I think what I appreciate the most about R, is, how much energy people put into developing packages.
 Claudia Kasper  gave a presentation about Creating reproducible analyses and reports with R Markdown on October 17 2018, at our 5th meetup.

      <description>I think there is a lot of power in the Bayesian approach. The problem is the high entrance threshold due to the computational issues that it poses. So I am always very happy to talk about the benefits of Bayesian statistics and show how simple a model can look like.
 In past April, Elizaveta Semenova  gave an introduction to Bayesian inference in R, using Stan at our third meetup.</description>

      <description>The learning process is always two fold. On the one side it&amp;rsquo;s really just learning about statistical concepts and methods, but then on the other hand it&amp;rsquo;s also about to program the analysis in R.
 At our very first meetup, Leonore Wigger  gave a short presentation on how to arrange multiple ggplot plots onto multipage PDFs.

R-Ladies Lausanne: What is the work that you do? Leonore Wigger: I work 50% at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the other 50% at the University of Lausanne, at the Lausanne Genomic Technologies Facility, which is a service provider for RNA and DNA analysis.</description>

      <description>I feel that learning to program in R provided me with a mindset that helps me understand today&amp;rsquo;s technology much better.
 Rosalie Bruel  has a background in ecology research, where she just finished her PhD on lakes ecological response to climate change.
As one of our first supporters, she missed our lightening talk session in June as she will soon head to Vermont.
Luckily for us, she proposed to do a twitter thread instead on her work in environmental research.</description>

      <description>The reason I presented at R-Ladies, is, that when I had done my first shiny app, I felt it was really amazing and I really wanted to share my experience of doing that, because it was quite easy.
 Elisabeth Dahlqwist  gave an introduction to Shiny at our second R-Ladies Lausanne meetup.


Sina R&amp;uuml;eger: What is the work that you do? Elisabeth Dahlqwist: I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in Biostatistics at Karoliska Institute in Stockholm.</description>
