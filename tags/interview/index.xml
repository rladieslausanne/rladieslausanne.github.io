      <description>I feel that learning to program in R provided me with a mindset that helps me understand today&amp;rsquo;s technology much better.
 Rosalie Bruel  has a background in ecology research, where she just finished her PhD on lakes ecological response to climate change.
As one of our first supporters, she missed our lightening talk session in June as she will soon head to Vermont.
Luckily for us, she proposed to do a twitter thread instead on her work in environmental research.</description>

      <description>The reason I presented at R-Ladies, is, that when I had done my first shiny app, I felt it was really amazing and I really wanted to share my experience of doing that, because it was quite easy.
 Elisabeth Dahlqwist  gave an introduction to Shiny at our second R-Ladies Lausanne meetup.


Sina R&amp;uuml;eger: What is the work that you do? Elisabeth Dahlqwist: I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in Biostatistics at Karoliska Institute in Stockholm.</description>
