      <description>I think what I appreciate the most about R, is, how much energy people put into developing packages.
 Claudia Kasper  gave a presentation about Creating reproducible analyses and reports with R Markdown on October 17 2018, at our 5th meetup.

      <description>I think there is a lot of power in the Bayesian approach. The problem is the high entrance threshold due to the computational issues that it poses. So I am always very happy to talk about the benefits of Bayesian statistics and show how simple a model can look like.
 In past April, Elizaveta Semenova  gave an introduction to Bayesian inference in R, using Stan at our third meetup.</description>
