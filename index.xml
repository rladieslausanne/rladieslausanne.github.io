      <description>The reason I presented at R-Ladies, is, that when I had done my first shiny app, I felt it was really amazing and I really wanted to share my experience of doing that, because it was quite easy.
 Elisabeth Dahlqwist  gave an introduction to Shiny at our second R-Ladies Lausanne meetup.
