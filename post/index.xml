      <description>I attended one of the first R-Ladies meetup and I liked the dynamics of the meeting.
 In June, Liza Darrous  gave a talk entitled &amp;ldquo;Talking in Circos - circular visualisation in R&amp;rdquo; and introduced us to the package Rcircos.
R-Ladies Lausanne: What is the work that you do? Liza Darrous: I&amp;rsquo;m a master student, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently working with statistical biology and a bit of method development.</description>

      <description>I think what I appreciate the most about R, is, how much energy people put into developing packages.
 Claudia Kasper  gave a presentation about Creating reproducible analyses and reports with R Markdown on October 17 2018, at our 5th meetup.

      <description>I think there is a lot of power in the Bayesian approach. The problem is the high entrance threshold due to the computational issues that it poses. So I am always very happy to talk about the benefits of Bayesian statistics and show how simple a model can look like.
 In past April, Elizaveta Semenova  gave an introduction to Bayesian inference in R, using Stan at our third meetup.</description>

      <description>The learning process is always two fold. On the one side it&amp;rsquo;s really just learning about statistical concepts and methods, but then on the other hand it&amp;rsquo;s also about to program the analysis in R.
 At our very first meetup, Leonore Wigger  gave a short presentation on how to arrange multiple ggplot plots onto multipage PDFs.

R-Ladies Lausanne: What is the work that you do? Leonore Wigger: I work 50% at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the other 50% at the University of Lausanne, at the Lausanne Genomic Technologies Facility, which is a service provider for RNA and DNA analysis.</description>

      <description>The reason I presented at R-Ladies, is, that when I had done my first shiny app, I felt it was really amazing and I really wanted to share my experience of doing that, because it was quite easy.
 Elisabeth Dahlqwist  gave an introduction to Shiny at our second R-Ladies Lausanne meetup.


Sina R&amp;uuml;eger: What is the work that you do? Elisabeth Dahlqwist: I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in Biostatistics at Karoliska Institute in Stockholm.</description>
