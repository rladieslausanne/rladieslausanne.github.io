<p><em>I attended one of the first R-Ladies meetup and I liked the dynamics of the meeting.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In June, Liza Darrous <a href="https://twitter.com/LizaMGD"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a> gave a talk entitled <strong>&ldquo;Talking in Circos - circular visualisation in R&rdquo;</strong> and introduced us to the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCircos/index.html"><code>Rcircos</code></a>.</p>

<h4 id="r-ladies-lausanne-what-is-the-work-that-you-do">R-Ladies Lausanne: What is the work that you do?</h4>

<p><u>Liza Darrous</u>: I&rsquo;m a master student, and I&rsquo;m currently working with statistical biology and a bit of method development.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-do-you-use-r-for-at-work">RLL: What do you use R for at work?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: Pretty much everything! To read data, load data, run algorithms and scripts, maths even.</p>

<h4 id="rll-where-and-when-did-you-learn-r">RLL: Where and when did you learn R?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: I learned it in my first year of Bachelor degree. We had to take a statistics course and that&rsquo;s when I first learned R. It was really nice, my eyes opened!</p>

<h4 id="rll-for-you-what-is-the-most-important-quality-to-be-a-good-r-user">RLL: For you, what is the most important quality to be a good R-user?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: The ability to use Google or any other search engine, because it&rsquo;s a very open-source project and there is a big online community. And there are so many packages that you can&rsquo;t keep track of, so you need to be able to find what you need.</p>

<h4 id="rll-do-you-use-r-outside-work">RLL: Do you use R outside work?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: I did try to use R once to create a database of all the movies I watched and all the movies I wanted to watch.</p>

<h4 id="rll-woh-that-s-cool-did-you-use-the-random-function-to-decide-which-movie-you-should-watch-next">RLL: Woh, that&rsquo;s cool! Did you use the <code>random()</code> function to decide which movie you should watch next?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: Yes, exactly. It was for me and my family, we were always fighting about what movie we wanted to watch, so that solved the case!</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-are-your-favourite-r-tools">RLL: What are your favourite R tools?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: I think I am most proud of using the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html"><code>dplyr</code></a>, because it took a lot to learn, it has a very deep learning curve, I&rsquo;m not even done yet but I do like the functionality of it. And I like the <code>random()</code> function, I use it a lot, I set seeds with it.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-resources-do-you-use-when-you-get-stuck">RLL: What resources do you use when you get stuck?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: Google, and definitely stackoverflow. I once had to go for a Google Group for some specific package, and it was another different experience, because you can&rsquo;t upvote or downvote so you get all the bad and the good answers.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-do-you-aspire-to-learn-in-r">RLL: What do you aspire to learn in R?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: I do want to make my own package. I always had this in the back of my head, to make a functionning package.</p>

<h4 id="rll-do-you-already-know-what-you-would-like-to-include-in-this-package">RLL: Do you already know what you would like to include in this package?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: My bachelors&rsquo;s project, I think. I was kind of motivated to turn it into a package, it was doing combinations of SNPs, trying to see whether they fit through different logic gates for example. And that could easily be turned into a package I guess, but I just never truly found the motivation nor the time.</p>

<h4 id="rll-what-motivated-you-to-give-a-talk-at-r-ladies-lausanne">RLL: What motivated you to give a talk at R-Ladies Lausanne?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: I liked the theme, there were <em>thundeR talks</em>, so not a lot of pressure and the possibility to choose any package that I liked. So I chose <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCircos/index.html"><code>Rcircos</code></a> because I worked with it for a long time and I was pretty much confortable with it. I attended one of the first R-Ladies meetup and I liked the dynamics of the meeting.</p>

<h4 id="rll-was-it-a-good-experience-for-you">RLL: Was it a good experience for you?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: It was a really great experience. It was one of my first public speaking events in Lausanne, for a group of people who were actually very nice, very enthusiastic. And apparently they went out of the room having learnt something, that was very cool.</p>

<h4 id="rll-anything-you-want-to-add">RLL:   Anything you want to add?</h4>

<p><u>LD</u>: I would like to thank R-Ladies for this opportunity. And I am very happy to be part of the group. I hope to hear and probably give more talks in the future!</p>

<h4 id="rll-thank-you-liza-for-answering-our-questions-we-hope-to-see-you-soon-at-one-of-our-next-meetups">RLL: Thank you Liza for answering our questions, we hope to see you soon at one of our next meetups!</h4>
